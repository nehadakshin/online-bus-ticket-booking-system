# online-bus-ticket-booking-system
The online bus ticket booking system is designed to provide users with a seamless experience from searching for available buses to confirming their bookings. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, features a user-friendly interface with pages for home, search, booking, payment, and confirmation.
Users can input their departure and destination locations, along with the date of travel, on the homepage, and upon submitting the search form, they are presented with available buses matching their criteria. Each bus listing includes departure times, prices, and available seats. 
After confirming the booking, users are directed to the payment page where they can securely complete the transaction. 
The backend, powered by PHP and MySQL with phpMyAdmin, manages user authentication, bus schedules, bookings, and payment processing, ensuring data integrity and security throughout the booking process.
